# RevoU-FSSE-2023H2 _ Alifah Syamsul _ W2 Intermediate Assignment _ Mika Responsive Webpage Assignment

This project is a fully-responsive webpage dedicated to my favourite singer of all time, Mika. This webpage was created by Alifah Syamsul to fulfil the Week-2 Intermediate Assignment as part of RevoU's Full-stack Software Engineering Program 2023H2.

## Features
